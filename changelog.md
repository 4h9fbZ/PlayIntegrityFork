# v12.2

- Fix more crash issues.
- Remove C++ code from main.cpp and strip libraries size.
- Hardcode classes.dex into libs.
- Using Shadowhook for arm64 and arm (smartphones), using Dobby for x86, x86_64 (emulators)

This should be the final build until Google "unfix" (again) the module. If you want to report a crash report or any other issue, please, always provide logs.
