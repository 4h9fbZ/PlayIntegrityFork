# v13.7

- Removed custom resetprop.
- Removed custom props spoof.
- Removed weird code.

If you want an undetectable resetprop, use Kitsune Magisk.
If you want to spoof your own props, modify the props in source code and build by yourself.
Should work and don't crash nothing.

Maybe in a future I do a custom spoof version... But I won't release it as stable build.

I recommend to clear GMS data and cache before reboot.
