# v13.7

- Removed custom resetprop.
- Removed custom props spoof.
- Removed weird code.

If you want an undetectable resetprop, use Kitsune Magisk.
If you want to spoof your own props, modify the props in source code and build by yourself.
Or you can use unstable build, you can download in GitHub repo.
Should work and don't crash nothing.

I recommend to clear GMS data and cache before reboot.
